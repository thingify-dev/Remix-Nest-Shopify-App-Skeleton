# Description

Shopify app template using NestJS for backend and RemixJS for app side. Created to give a good starting point for any size app project.

We use pnpm for both and tried to keep most of the commands the same as much as possible.

I prefer to prepend the commands with env, then the action to do.

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ pnpm dev:start 


# production mode
$ pnpm prod:start 
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```
