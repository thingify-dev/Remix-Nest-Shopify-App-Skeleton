# Hello

This repo is a great starting point for making all sizes of Shopify apps. The
idea was to create something solid and can be used whether you are making a sma
ll weekend app, or a large scale app.

This is not meant to be used as a monolith, but it is package as such for easier
maintainability. You can absolutely break the app out into your own repos, one
for client, one for API. But then again, I'm not your dad so do what you want.

## Tech used

- RemixJS (frontend)
- NestJS (backend)
- Prisma (ORM)
- Cloudflare (tunnel for local development)
